# popx-login

PopX Login is a small React app that recreates a mobile-style onboarding flow (landing, signup, login, profile) based on an Adobe XD design for a 375 × 812 viewport.​
The layout is built to be as close as possible to the provided design, using absolute positioning, fixed dimensions, and the Rubik Google Font.

## Features

  Signup (full form with radio buttons).​
  
  Login (email, password, disabled login button style).​
